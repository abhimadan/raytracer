# raytracer

A raytracer written in Rust.

It currently knows how to render spheres, and use diffuse and ambient lighting. It also has anti-aliasing.

Features to add in the future:
* Specular lighting
* Reflection and refraction
* More geometry (e.g. planes, meshes)

Also, the code is currently in one file, and would be easier to develope if it was more modular.
This is the most urgent thing I need to do, before adding any more features.
